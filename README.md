Detecting Age, Gender, Ethencity of a person by uploding image in gui

## To run Gui
1. clone this repository
2. Run the [GUI.py](https://github.com/Vasantharish/My-project/blob/3414b8e21671e7adc1769cea750a77c33e96aca1/GUI.py)file
3. with options you can select images to test by choosing file or select custom images
4. click show selected button if you're selected custom images
